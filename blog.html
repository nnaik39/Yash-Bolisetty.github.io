            <p class="blog-post-meta">December 30, 2016 by <a href="index.html">Nandita</a></p>

            <p>Dear readers,</p>
            <hr>
            <p> 
              There's something about the Vietnam War which makes even the most hardened writer blush. Vietnam
              is the only war from which America has not emerged a hero. We didn't come out feeling noble or heroic. In fact,
              by most accounts, the war was traumatic and costly. According
              to a Stanford article titled "The Psychological Effects of the Vietnam War," the Vietnam War has become a
              As someone who has neither experienced a war nor reached her sixteenth birthday, I can attest to my own woeful
              inexperience in these matters. However, I am a book geek. Where my imagination fails, I turn to literature.
              Surely, literature must be able to capture the essence of serving in a war--shouldn't it?
              Tim O'Brien once said about the Vietnam War, "“There is no clarity. Everything swirls. The old rules are no longer binding, the old truths no longer true.
              Right spills over into wrong. Order blends into chaos, love into hate, ugliness into beauty, law into anarchy,
              civility into savagery. The vapors suck you in. You can’t tell where you are, or why you’re there, and the
              only certainty is overwhelming ambiguity."
              Is this what a war is like? As someone who has never experienced that kind of pain, I can't say that the words
              take me any closer to experiencing it. The fact is, war literature is a paradox in of itself, a representation
              of what is unrepresentable. War of any sorts is too traumatic to explain in simple language. As a result, writers
              often turn to lurid, gory descriptions, or vague ones, like O'Brien's. There is also Dien Cai Dau, by Yusuf
              Komunyakaa, in which the first poem, Camoflauging the Chimera, describes a troop getting ready for an ambush,
              ending with "as a world revolved / under each man's eyelid." This description of worlds under eyelids represents
              what each man has seen in the war. The poem makes no attempt to describe what each man has seen. It just mentions
              that a war spans worlds, which I think is accurate.
              In attempting to analyze a poem like this, I must first acknowledge that it is impossible to comprehend it. But then, you may
              ask, what is the point of writing war literature? To that, I argue that it is essential that we keep trying to
              understand, and that attempting to understand, although doomed to fail, is the best we can do to honor what
              those veterans went through. In other words, we owe it to the people in that war to try and understand what they
              went through.              
              This is my challenge when dealing with the Vietnam War. I must be careful. I am walking on a shattered glass here,
              and not to be dramatic, but I am committed to picking up the pieces and connecting the dots, even if I end up
              bleeding.
